# AI-Object-Detection

Convolutional neural network trained for object detection drone targeting. Utilizes single shot architecture with MobileNetV3 for fast processing. Adjusted to custom testing data and local dependencies.

COMMON ERROR: Compiled h(5) files wil only work with older versions of TensorFlow (i.e. tensorflow==2.12.0)

Drag any of the testing data under the data folder into images. Run "runDetections.py" for object detections.
